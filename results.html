            <h2 class="objective">Objective – Passing by Reference vs Passing by Value </h2>

                <p>With JavaScript, the global scope is the JavaScript environment (browser, NodeJS). A global variable is a variable defined in the 'global' scope. If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a global variable.  

                Functions can access global variables and modify them. If a function changes an object property, it changes the original value. Changes to object properties are visible (reflected) outside the function. 

                Variables total and i are globally referenced variables being modified within function scope.</p>

            <h2 class="objective">Objective – Floating-Point Arithmetic</h2>

                <p>Floating-point arithmetic is not always 100% accurate in JavaScript. Numbers like 1/3 i.e., 0.33333.....  will round at an unknown point. So if we add it with another value, whose value is also decimal, we will not get the intended result. When two decimals are added there will be rounding errors. 0.3 + 0.6 = 0.8999999999999999</p>

            <h2 class="objective">Objective - String Methods</h2>

                <p>Methods and properties are available to strings because JavaScript treats strings as objects when executing methods and properties.  

                substring() - returns the part of the string between the start and end indexes, or to the end of the string.   

                slice() - Extracts a part of a string and returns a new string

                substr() - Extracts a number of characters from a string, from a start index (position)

                chunk() - Not a string method. Array method used to break the arrays in to small chunks.

            <h2 class="objective">Objective - Detect and Analyze errors</h2>

                <p>The JavaScript Syntax Error occurs when trying to interpret code that is not syntactically valid. For example, a Syntax Error can occur if a closing brace ( } ) is left off when defining a JavaScript function. Syntax errors can be minimized by paying attention to detail and making sure all expressions in code are syntactically correct.</p>

            <h2 class="objective">Objective – Encapsulation</h2>

                <p>A constructor is a function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class. In JavaScript, a constructor gets invoked when an object is created using the new keyword. When a constructor gets invoked in JavaScript, the following sequence of operations take place:
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>1. A new empty object gets created.
                <br>2. The this keyword begins to refer to the new object and it becomes the current instance object.
                <br>3. The new object is then returned as the return value of the constructor.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                In JavaScript, which object this keyword refers to depends on how this is being invoked (called). In a function, the value of this is the global object. In a method, the value of this is the object used to call the method.  
                <br>
                <br>
                var supplier = new Supplier() === this === Supplier { supply: [Function (anonymous)] } 
                <br>
                var supply = supplier.supply(); === this === Supplier { supply: [Function (anonymous)] }</p>

            <h2 class="objective">Objective – Abstraction</h2>
                <p>All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype. You cannot add a new property to an existing object constructor. To add a new property or method to a constructor, add it to the constructor function using the JavaScript prototype property.</p>

            <h2 class="objective">Objective – HTML DOM and Events</h2>
                <p>HTML DOM events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document. Bubbling is the principle that when an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors. Almost all events bubble.</p>

            <h2 class="objective">Objective – HTML DOM and Node Navigation</h2>
                <p>According to the W3C HTML DOM standard, everything in an HTML document is a node: 
                <br>
                <br>
                1. The entire document is a document node.
                <br>2. Every HTML element is an element node.
                <br>3. The text inside HTML elements are text nodes.
                <br>4. Every HTML attribute is an attribute node (deprecated).
                <br>5. All comments are comment nodes.
                <br>
                <br>
                The nodes in the node tree have a hierarchical relationship to each other. The terms parent, child, and sibling are used to describe the relationships. With the HTML DOM, you can navigate to the first child of a parent using node relationships.

            <h2 class="objective">Objective – Control Flow </h2>

                <p>A script tag with defer waits until the entire parser is done and then runs all scripts marked with defer in the order they were encountered. This allows you to mark several scripts that depend upon one another as defer. They will all get postponed until after the document parser is done, but they will execute in the order they were encountered preserving their dependencies</p>
